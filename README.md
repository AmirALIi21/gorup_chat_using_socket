hi there agian this a group chat for local and online usage and you can have multipe clients.
how it works :(same computer) run the server.py then use another terminal to run the clients (each client on seperate terminal ) 
(multipe computers ) : run the server.py on server computer (the computer server can also be the client by it self by following the (same computer) protocol )then  replace the server ip in the clients
codes section between two ' " '(you can see the ip server in server computer terminal ) then run the clients on the others computers 
(online chat) uploade the server.py on your server the run it and replace the server ip in your client codes and you will be good to go
